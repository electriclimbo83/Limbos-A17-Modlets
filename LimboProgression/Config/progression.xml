		Look at his minibike storage example here:
		
		<set xpath="/lootcontainers/lootcontainer[@id='62']/@size">7,6</set>
		
		We do not need the [] brackets, nor the @id.  We just need /progression/level/@skill_points_per_level
		
		See below example on how to increase the max player level from 300 to 500:
	
	<set xpath = "/progression/level/max_level">500</set>
	
	This would change the player's max level from 300 to 500 !-->
	
	<set xpath = "/progression/level/@skill_points_per_level">2</set>
